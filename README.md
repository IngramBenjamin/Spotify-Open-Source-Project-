# Spotify-Open-Source-Project-
Project with Spotify API data obtained from Kaggle. Analysis in Python, results via Tableau storyboard
Spotify is a Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded in 2006. It is 
one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 433 million monthly 
active users. Spotify offers digital copyright restricted music and podcasts, including 
more than 82 million songs, from record labels and media companies, and is available 
in 180+ countries. In this analysis, I explored a dataset containing songs from 
Spotify’s ‘Weekly Top Songs’ charts for each country for the weeks 2/4/21 through 
7/14/22, in order to find insights into which artists, songs, and genres are most popular 
across geographical markets, and which song attributes are most prevalent in the most 
popular songs, or highest ranked songs during the period.

# Data Sources
Spotify Weekly Top 200 Songs Streaming Data
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yelexa/spotify200

The Spotify Weekly Top Songs is an open data source, collected by Spotify and made 
publicly available via Spotify’s API. The data set was posted to Kaggle.com by a user in 
the community who obtained the datasets from Spotify and consolidated them into a 
single dataset. As the dataset was uploaded and shared with the Kaggle Community by
a user in the community, the data collection process was reviewed and the data set 
briefly reviewed to determine its accuracy and authenticity.
